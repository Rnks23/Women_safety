üõ°Ô∏è SOS Watch: The Wearable Safety Device
The SOS Watch is a wearable device specifically designed for women‚Äôs safety, offering a variety of features aimed at providing assistance during emergencies. When activated, it sends real-time alerts and offers continuous support until help arrives. This device is seamlessly integrated with the Shield_Her software platform.

üîë Key Features of the SOS Watch
Geofencing:

The watch utilizes geofencing to alert authorities if the wearer moves outside a predefined safe zone.
This feature helps ensure safety within designated safe areas and sends an alert if the wearer is taken to an unknown location.
Path Locking:

This feature allows the wearer to set a predefined path when traveling from one location to another.
If the person deviates from the locked path, an alert is immediately triggered, notifying authorities and emergency contacts.
Send Photos:

The watch is equipped with a built-in camera that captures photos automatically when an SOS is triggered.
The photos are sent in real-time to the authorities and saved on the cloud for additional security.
Real-Time Voice Streaming:

When the SOS mode is activated, the watch streams live audio from the surrounding environment.
This helps authorities and emergency contacts to assess the situation and take swift action based on the live feed.
Voice Activation:

The SOS function can be activated by voice commands, making it easy to use in situations where pressing a button may not be feasible.
Instant SOS Button:

The wearer can also manually activate the SOS function by pressing the button on the watch three times.
This immediately sends location details, alerts emergency contacts, and starts the photo and voice stream.
Integration with Shield_Her:

The SOS Watch seamlessly connects with the Shield_Her software system, allowing real-time alerts and monitoring from local authorities.
The system can display the wearer‚Äôs location, images, and voice stream in the monitoring application.
üí° How It Works
Real-Time Processing: Processes live CCTV feeds to detect people, classify gender, and monitor activity in real-time.
Threat Detection: Identifies abnormal situations such as women being surrounded by men, lone women in risky environments, or distress gestures.
Alert System: Sends immediate alerts to local authorities or emergency contacts when threats are detected.
Wearable Device Integration: The SOS Watch provides a personal, mobile safety net through geofencing, path locking, and real-time audio and image streaming.
